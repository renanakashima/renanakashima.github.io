Hey thereðŸ‘‹ I am currently a final-year undergraduate at The University of Tokyo, majoring in an interdisciplinary field that blends Management, Technology, and Entrepreneurship. From August 2024 to June 2025, I am on exchange at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL), diving deeply into Computer Science research.

My academic interest lies in generative modeling, multimodal learning, and computer vision. Ultimately, I want to contribute to building intelligent agents capable of human-like interaction and robust, generalized understanding of diverse environments.

Outside research, you may sometimes find me at opera houses and classical music concerts. Growing up and attending school in the US for a total of 8 years has also shaped who I am today.

Always eager to connect with talented researchers and like-minded peers ---feel free to reach out!
